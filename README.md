This is my second attempt at creating a messaging app, which is fairly better than the previous one.
I used reactJS as front-end and firebase as backend since it is easier to implement firebase and it also has realtime database. Because of Firebase, I was able to use Google Authentication as well. This app still needs its finishing touches but it has already turned out to be better than my previous messaging app.

Here is the first version of the app:
